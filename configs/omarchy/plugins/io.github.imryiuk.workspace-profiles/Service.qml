// Two jobs, both small: apply the login profile once per boot, and expose the
// apply commands over IPC so a profile can be launched from a keybinding
// without going near the bar.
//
// Deliberately thin. All of the decision-making — is there a store, is a login
// profile set, is this start a login at all rather than a restarted shell, has
// this boot already been handled — lives in
// bin/workspace-profiles-apply, which exits in milliseconds when the answer is
// no. Duplicating those checks here would mean two places to keep in agreement,
// and the shell would carry a JSON parse and a file watch it has no other use
// for.
